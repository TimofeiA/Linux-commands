The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable

bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file '{}' \; | grep ASCII

The most likely candidate would be find.
We use -size 1033 to look for the file-size requirement.
We use -type f to only look at files.
We use -exec file '{}' \;, to execute the file command and get the file data type.
After that, we simply need to filter the output for the file type ‘ASCII’ again. 2
